Me thinks it is like a weasel!
==============================

Simple script which generates any given input phrase using an extremely simple
genetic algorithm.

By default, the script will generate 'Me thinks it is like a Weasel' which is what Richard Dawkin's
uses for his example. The phrase is an excerpt from Hamlet. You can specify a different target as follows:

    python weasel.py --target "My Message Here"

This mini-task was completely inspired and based off what Richard Dawkin's performs in
his book 'The Blind Watchmaker' as a way of explaining accumulations of random small change to
generate complex sequences through selection and inheritance.

The script runs with Python 2.7
