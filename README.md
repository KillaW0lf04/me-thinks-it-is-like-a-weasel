Me thinks it is like a weasel!
==============================

Simple script which generates the phrase 'ME THINKS ITS LIKE A WEASEL' using an extremely simple
genetic algorithm.

This mini-task was completely inspired and based off what Richard Dawkin's performs in
his book 'The Blind Watchmaker' as a way of explaining accumulations of random small change to
generate complex sequences through selection and inheritance.

The script runs with Python 2.7
